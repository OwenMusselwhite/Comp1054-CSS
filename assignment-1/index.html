            <p>[Verse 1]
I, I was the lonely one
Wondering what went wrong
Why love had gone and left me lonely
I, I was so confused
Feeling like I'd just been used
Then you came to me, and my loneliness left me

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak
But now that I've found you

[Chorus]
Even the nights are better now that we're here together
Even the nights are better since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter when someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better since I found you

[Verse 2]
You, you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how to ease the pain
And you did more than mend a broken heart
'Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see that you feel the same way</p>

                <p>[Pre-Chorus]
I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me
And now that I've found you

[Chorus]
Even the nights are better now that we're here together
Even the nights are better since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter when someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better since I found you

[Instrumental - Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me until you told me, and now that I've found you

[Chorus]
Even the nights are better now that we're here together
Even the nights are better since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter when someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better since I found you, oh

[Outro]
Even the nights are better now that we're here together
Even the nights are better since I found you, oh</p>
